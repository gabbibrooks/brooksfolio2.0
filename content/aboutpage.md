## How's it going?

My name is Gabbi, and I've been working as a software developer and originally started working mainly with backend systems in C# since that what I focused on during my time at the University of Northern Colorado and was really interested in game development. It wasn't until after I had graduated that I was introduced to Vue.js and really started to enjoy web and frontend development. Currently, I work at a startup called Storyboard as a Frontend Engineer, building web based audio communication tools for transportation companies. I am also a co-organizer of the Jamstack Denver Meetup and run the audio/video piece for the group.

When I'm not coding, I like to do a variety of things! I play a lot of video games since that is originally what got me into development in the first place, The Witcher 3, Mass Effect, and Nier: Automata being some of my favorites. I also love live music and try to go to as many shows as I can throughout the year and during the wintertime, I like to go snowboarding up in the beautiful Colorado mountains. Recently I've started getting into photography as well, which has become a new hobby of mine that I've started to really love.
